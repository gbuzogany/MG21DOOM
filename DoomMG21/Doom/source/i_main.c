/*  Doom Port on xMG21/Ikea Tradfri
 *  by Nicola Wrachien (next-hack in the comments)
 *
 *  This port is based on the excellent doomhack's GBA Doom Port.
 *  Several data structures and functions have been optimized to fit the
 *  96kB + 12kB memory of xMG21 devices. Z-Depth Light has been restored with almost
 *  no RAM consumption!
 *
 *  PrBoom: a Doom port merged with LxDoom and LSDLDoom
 *  based on BOOM, a modified and improved DOOM engine

 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      Startup and quit functions. Handles signals, inits the
 *      memory management, then calls D_DoomMain. Also contains
 *      I_Init which does other system-related startup stuff.
 *
 *      next-hack: put sound init and time functions
