/*  Doom Port on xMG21/Ikea Tradfri
 *  by Nicola Wrachien (next-hack in the comments)
 *
 *  This port is based on the excellent doomhack's GBA Doom Port.
 *  Several data structures and functions have been optimized to fit the
 *  96kB + 12kB memory of xMG21 devices. Z-Depth Light has been restored with almost
 *  no RAM consumption!
 *
 *  PrBoom: a Doom port merged with LxDoom and LSDLDoom
 *  based on BOOM, a modified and improved DOOM engine

 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *      Here is a core component: drawing the floors and ceilings,
 *       while maintaining a per column clipping list only.
 *      Moreover, the sky areas have to be determined.
 *
 * MAXVISPLANES is no longer a limit on the number of visplanes,
 * but a limit on the number of hash slots; larger numbers mean
 * better performance usually but after a point they are wasted,
 * and memory and time overheads creep in.
 *
 * For more information on visplanes, see:
