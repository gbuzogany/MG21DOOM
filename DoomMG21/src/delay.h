 *  Doom Port on xMG21/Ikea Tradfri by Nicola Wrachien (next-hack in comments)
 *
 *  This port is based on the excellent doomhack's GBA Doom Port.
 *  Several data structures and functions have been optimized to fit the
 *  96kB + 12kB memory of xMG21 devices. Z-Depth Light has been restored with almost
 *  no RAM consumption!
 *
 *  PrBoom: a Doom port merged with LxDoom and LSDLDoom
 *  based on BOOM, a modified and improved DOOM engine
